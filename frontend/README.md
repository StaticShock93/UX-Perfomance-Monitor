# UX Monitor App (WIP)

A live UX performance monitor that captures and visualizes animation metrics from real user sessions. 

Provides devs with a lightweight performance HUD that tracks and visualizes real-time rendering metrics in the browser. It calculates FPS, dropped frames, and an overall UX health score (0â€“100) based on animation smoothness. A mini bar graph highlights recent performance blips to help identify jank and frame drops. Ideal for debugging animation-heavy UIs.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started


```bash
npm install ux-dev-monitor-tool

--> In component/page of choice
import UXMonitorOverlay from 'ux-dev-monitor-tool' 
```
## Key Metrics & Formulas:

FPS (frames per second):
FPS = frameCount / (totalTime / 1000)

Dropped Frames:
Dropped = expectedFrames - 1
(Assumes 60fps target; 1 frame always rendered)

UX Score:
Score = 100 âˆ’ (60 âˆ’ avgFPS) Ã— 3 âˆ’ droppedFrames Ã— 5
**(Stricter penalties for jank & stutter)**

ðŸ“Š Includes a real-time blip bar to visualize dropped frames over the last ~3 seconds
